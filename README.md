"Terms and Conditions" is the document stating the relationship between the provider of a service and its user. 
It provides useful information about the use of the content(copyright), the rules that users must follow while interacting with one another, etc. 
But no matter how important these aspects are, some websites make their contracts too hard to understand, so the user is inclined to skip it and accept it without second doubt.
This app has the purpose to analyze and modify the "Terms and Conditions" document to be easy to understand and point out the main problems in it.
